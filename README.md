### Overview
This is an entity resolution app. It has a frontent web made with node.js. First time on front end I definitely struggled there. There is a data generation componenent. Currently it can only be tiggered through running the main or the method `generate_data`. Note this is a work in progress.

`run.py` will start the web application


## Bugs and improvements
- Business link is on the customer not the business
- Saving graph displayed
- Adding report features
- Making the matching user adjustable, and can be activated through the site
- Make the data more complex, maybe bad actors generated or make a custom dataset with a story
- Improve UI entity details area A lot
